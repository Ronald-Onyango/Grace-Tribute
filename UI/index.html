            <p>God saw you getting tired when a cure was not to be. So he wrapped his arms around you and whispered, "Come unto me". God's garden must be beautiful, he only takes the best. So when I saw you sleeping so peacefully and free from pain, I couldn't wish for more. I love you Jahera na.</p>
