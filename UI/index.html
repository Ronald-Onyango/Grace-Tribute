        <h1>Life</h1>
        <p>The Late Pst. Grace Ajiambo Bala was born on 23rd November to the Late John Juma Bala and Mama      Agnetta
            Ongoche Bala of Sifuyo village, Busia county.
            She began her primary education at Elwobe Primary School in Maseno and finished at Munami Primary School. <br> Grace was leter admitted to Butere Girls High School where she successfuly completed her secondary education before joining Nangina Polytechnic where she pursued a course in clothing and textile. <br> <br>
            Due to her great ambition, Grace decided to move to Nairobi to settle on her career and it's there that she met her spouse, Dick Odhiambo Bura, in the year 2003. Grace and Dick were blessed with three children; Robert, Mercy and Natalie. She has left behind two grandchildren; Patrick and Anthony. <br> <br>
            Grace was the daughter-in-law to the Late John Bura and Sibia Bura. She was the sister to Kennedy, Salome, Clara, Jane, Hellen, Patrick, Risper, Martin and Tom. She was a step-sister to the Late Dinah, Lukas, Late Victorinah, Michael and Janepheser. She was the sister-in-law to Pamella, Sarah Josephine,Bennah, Emilly, Consolata, Millicent, Benta, Caroline, Eunice, Debra Winnie and Sharon. The brothers-in-law are Duncan, Bob, Victor and Meja.
        </p>
        <h1>Salvation and Ministry</h1>
        <p>Grace received Christ in the year 2012 and was serving at Mwiki Altar, under the Ministry of Repentance and Holiness, where she diligently served in the security department before being raised as an Associate Pastor on August 2017. 
        She was so dedicated in God's service and kept evangelising to all she met, since she could not afford to keep the joy of salvation to herself. The sociality she showed not only in church but also to the world made her gain so many friends in all sorts of life, and we can undoubtedly say she impacted so many lives with her selflessness by leading them to her Saviour.</p> <br>
        <h1>Sickness</h1>
        <p>Pst. Grace was living happily with the family in Kasarani untill December 2018 when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She was first admitted at St. Francis Mission Hospital in Kasarani in October 2019 for blood transfusion and management and was later discharged. She went  back home and continued with her daily life. On 24th December 2019, Grace was re-admitted at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) where she was diagnosed with end stage renal failure. She was at KNH under medical care until 20th February when she was dischaged from the hospital having improved tremendously. <br>
        On 13th March 2020, Grace was admitted back to KNH when she was seriously sick and had to go fo her dialysis. She was then transferred to the High Dependency Unit (HDU) on 15th March for close monitoring by the physicians. <br> <br>
        On the early morning of 18th March 2020, our Beloved Grace took her last breath at Kenyatta Hospital (HDU).</p>

            <p>There's a land that is fairer than day, <br> 
               And by faith we can see it afar; <br> 
               For the Father waits over the way, <br>
